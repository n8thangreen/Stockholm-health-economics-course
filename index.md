# Health economics modelling in R

{% include figure.html img="destinations-stockholm-banner-mobile-1024x553.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="Stockholm" width="75%" %}

> Karolinska Institutet and University College London will be hosting a course on health economics modelling in R.

* __Where__: Karolinska Institutet, Solna (see [program](https://n8thangreen.github.io/Stockholm-health-economics-course/content/program.html) for details of lecture rooms)
* __Date__: 9<sup>th</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> June 2022
* __Time__: 9:00 - 17:00
* __Instructor__: [Nathan Green](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=NGGRE44)


Learn about health economics modelling and how to implement a range of models in R.
The first day of the course will consist of lectures giving a grounding in health economics modelling for cost-effectiveness analyses from a Bayesian perspective.
The second day of the course will consist of computer labs in which models presented in Day 1 are implemented in R.

## Prerequisites
* __Day 1__: No health economics background is assumed. Basic statistics and probabilty is preferable and ideally some Bayesian inference.
* __Day 2__: Health economics modelling covered in Day 1 and basic R programming knowledge, including use of different types, reading and writing data, loops, writing functions.

## Lecture topics
* Introduction to health economic evaluations (HEE)
* Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for HEE
* Decision tree and Markov modelling in HEE


## Software
Required software (for day 2):
* R (free general statistical software)
* OpenBUGS (free software for Bayesian analysis)
* JAGS (alternative software for Bayesian analysis) â€“ probably the easiest option for Linux or Mac users

We suggest all participants attending day 2 bring a laptop on which they have installed R (along with the `BCEA` package) and OpenBUGS and/or JAGS.

Course faculty will assist you with the installation during the course if needed. Contact [Enoch Yi-Tung Chen](mailto:enoch.yitung.chen@ki.se) if you need help with installation prior to the course.



### Installation
The following sets out a basic installation process:

If necessary [download and install R](https://www.r-project.org/) and potentially a user interface to R like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

[Download and install JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/) as per operating system requriements;
and/or [OpenBUGS](https://openbugs.net/w/Downloads).

Install additional R packages: e.g., in R `install.packages("rjags")` and `install.packages("R2OpenBUGS")`.

## Target audience
The course is open to everyone with an interest in health economics modelling. The primary target audience is researchers knowledgeable about statistical modelling who are interested in learning health economics modelling. That is, we assume participants have prior knowledge of statistics but do not assume prior knowledge of health economics.

## Course certificate
Each participant will receive a certificate of attendance. There is no examination. The course is not an official university course and completion of the course does not automatically entitle academic credits.

## Registration
Registration: [Register via Google forms](https://forms.gle/iWhDxiLWY4nGW5JEA)

Cost: No charge to participants

Please register before June 1st. Class size is limited on day 2 (hands-on computer exercises). If the course is oversubscribed, priority will be given to staff and students at Karolinska Institutet.
