# Health economics modelling in R

{% include figure.html img="destinations-stockholm-banner-mobile-1024x553.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="Stockholm" width="75%" %}

> Karolinska Institutet and University College London will be hosting a course on health economics modelling in R.

* __Where__: Karolinska Institutet
* __Date__: 9<sup>th</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> June 2022
* __Time__: 9:00 - 18:00
* __Instructor__: [Nathan Green](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=NGGRE44)


Learn about health economics modelling and how to implement a range of models in R.
The first day of the course will consist of lectures giving a grounding in health economics modelling for cost-effectiveness analyses from a Bayesian perspective.
The second day of the course will consist of computer labs in which models presented in Day 1 are implemented in R.

## Prerequisites
* __Day 1__: No health economics background is assumed. Basic statistics and probabilty is preferable and ideally some Bayesian inference.
* __Day 2__: Health economics modelling covered in Day 1 and basic R programming knowledge, including use of different types, reading and writing data, loops, writing functions.

## Lecture topics
* Introduction to health economic evaluations (HEE)
* Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for HEE
* Decision tree and Markov modelling in HEE


## Software
Required software:
* R (free general statistical software)
* OpenBUGS (free software for Bayesian analysis)
* JAGS (alternative software for Bayesian analysis) â€“ probably the easiest option for Linux or Mac users

We suggest all participants bring a laptop on which they have installed R (along with the `BCEA` package) and OpenBUGS and/or JAGS.

Course faculty will assist you with the installation during the course if needed. Contact *name of TA* if you need help with installation prior to the course.



### Installation
The following sets out a basic installation process:

If necessary [download and install R](https://www.r-project.org/) and potentially a user interface to R like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

[Download and install JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/) as per operating system requriements;
and/or [OpenBUGS](https://openbugs.net/w/Downloads).

Install additional R packages: e.g., in R `install.packages("rjags")` and `install.packages("R2OpenBUGS")`.

## Target audience
Biomedical researchers/practitioners with a mathematics/statistics/computational-based degree (e.g., mathematics, statistics, bioinformatics, engineering, physics, computer science).

## Course certificate
Each participant will receive a certificate of attendance. There is no examination. The course is not an official university course and completion of the course does not automatically entitle academic credits.

Registration: xx

Cost: No charge to participants
